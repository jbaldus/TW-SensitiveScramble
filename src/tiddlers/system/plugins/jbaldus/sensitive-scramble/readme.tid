type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This plugin will render certain words using a very simple ROT-13 encryption to prevent casual observers from shoulder surfing. Importantly, this plugin ''does not'' actually encrypt the tiddlers--it simply renders the words that are in your list of sensitive words all scrambled up. //(If you're looking for actual encyption, ~TiddlyWiki has a built-in [[mechanism to encrypt|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Encryption.html]] the entire wiki, or use [[Encrypt Tiddler Plugin|http://danielorodriguez.com/TW5-EncryptTiddlerPlugin/]] by Danielo Rodriguez.)//
